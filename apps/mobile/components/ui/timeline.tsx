/**
 * Timeline — a vertical sequence of events.
 *
 * One `value` on the root says how far the sequence has got, and every item
 * resolves its own state from its `step` against it — completed below, active
 * at, inactive above. Stating it once is the point: a timeline whose items each
 * carried their own state would let you write two active items, or none.
 *
 * State is resolved in JS and handed down through context into `tv()` variants
 * rather than being read off the element, because React Native has no
 * attribute selectors for a stylesheet to key off. `Steps` resolves its states
 * the same way, so the two read as siblings.
 *
 * ## Two orientations
 *
 * Vertical is the default and the ordinary case. Horizontal lays the items out
 * as columns on a rail that runs off the side of the screen and is swiped
 * through, which is the arrangement a long span of time wants: a decade of
 * entries read top to bottom is a page nobody reaches the end of.
 *
 * The objection to a horizontal timeline is that each item gets a fifth of a
 * phone's width, which will not hold a date and a title. The answer is that it
 * does not have to fit — the rail is wider than the screen, and a column takes
 * the width its contents need. An item with nothing on it collapses to a tick,
 * so a quiet stretch compresses and a busy one keeps its room.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Timeline variant="icon" value={2}>
