/**
 * TimePicker — a time of day behind a trigger, in one of three faces.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const [time, setTime] = useState<TimeValue>();
 *
 * <TimePicker value={time} onValueChange={setTime} />
 * ```
 *
 * The value is `{ hour, minute }` on a 24-hour clock, whatever the face shows.
 * A 12-hour display is a rendering choice; storing 7pm as `{ hour: 7 }` plus a
 * meridiem flag would put the flag into every comparison downstream.
 *
 * ## Three layouts, because "pick a time" is three different tasks
 *
 * - **`wheel`** — hour, minute and meridiem as snapping columns. The precise
 *   one: any minute in the day is two or three flicks away. The default.
 * - **`clock`** — a face beside a list of times at a fixed step. For picking a
 *   *slot* rather than a time — a booking, a reminder, an appointment — where
 *   the face answers "is that morning or evening?" faster than reading digits.
 * - **`ruler`** — one large readout over a full-width scrubber. The coarse one,
 *   and the only one that reads at arm's length, so it is the one for a sheet
 *   with a thumb on it.
 *
 * All three produce the same value and take the same props. Swapping between
 * them is a one-word change, which is the point of them being one component.
 *
 * ## Presentation is separate from layout
 *
 * `popover`, `dialog` and `bottom-sheet` wrap the same panel; `inline` renders
 * it bare, for composing into a Frame or a form. Popover and sheet hand off to
 * `Popover`, which already owns both — but `Popover` has no dialog form, so
 * the switch lives here rather than being pushed down into it. A picker is
 * also the wrong place to widen a general-purpose overlay: the three shapes
 * differ in how they are *dismissed*, not in what they contain.
 *
 * ## Native scrolling where it helps
 *
 * The wheel and the clock's list are snapping scroll views, so they keep
 * platform momentum and edge behavior. The ruler maps the finger's horizontal
 * position directly to a time, because its selected point needs to travel
 * across the visible scale instead of staying fixed in the centre.
