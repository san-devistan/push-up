/**
 * Popover — a panel anchored to the thing that opened it.
 *
 * A dialog takes the screen and asks to be dealt with; a popover stays next to
 * its trigger and keeps the context around it visible. That difference is the
 * whole reason both exist, and it is why this one is positioned rather than
 * centred.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Popover>
 *   <Popover.Trigger>
 *     <Button variant="outline">Options</Button>
 *   </Popover.Trigger>
 *   <Popover.Content placement="bottom" align="end">
 *     <Popover.Title>Export</Popover.Title>
 *     <Popover.Description>Choose a format.</Popover.Description>
 *   </Popover.Content>
 * </Popover>
 * ```
 *
 * Placement is a preference, not a promise. The trigger is measured in window
 * coordinates when it is pressed, the panel measures itself on its first
 * layout, and the two are reconciled against the safe area: a panel that would
 * run off the bottom flips above the trigger, and one that would run off the
 * side slides back inside. So `placement="bottom"` means *below, if below
 * fits* — which is the only behaviour that survives a trigger near an edge.
 *
 * The first frame is rendered transparent, because the panel's own size is not
 * known until it has laid out once. Without that it would appear at the origin
 * and jump into place.
