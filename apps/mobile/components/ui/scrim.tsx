/**
 * Scrim — the layer behind an overlay.
 *
 * An overlay needs the screen behind it to recede. There are two honest ways to
 * do that: dim it, or blur it. Dimming is free and always works; blurring reads
 * as more physical — the content behind stays legible as shape and colour while
 * losing its detail — but it needs a native view to do it.
 *
 * `expo-blur` is resolved lazily and only when `blur` is asked for, so a project
 * that never blurs anything installs nothing. When it is asked for and the
 * package is missing, this falls back to a dim rather than failing: a blur you
 * cannot draw is better shown as a darkened screen than as a crash.
 * Reduce Transparency replaces the blur with an opaque, tint-aware surface.
 *
 * It fills its parent and does not intercept touches itself — the overlay layers
 * its own dismiss `Pressable` over it — so it is purely the visual backdrop.
