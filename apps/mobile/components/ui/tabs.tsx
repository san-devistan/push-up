/**
 * Tabs — segmented navigation between panels.
 *
 * The active tab is marked by one indicator that slides between measured
 * trigger positions rather than by a style on each trigger. That is what makes
 * the movement continuous: there is a single thing travelling, so a switch two
 * tabs away reads as one gesture instead of two states swapping.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Tabs defaultValue="account">
 *   <Tabs.List>
 *     <Tabs.Trigger value="account">Account</Tabs.Trigger>
 *     <Tabs.Trigger value="team" badge={<Badge>3</Badge>}>Team</Tabs.Trigger>
 *   </Tabs.List>
 *   <Tabs.Content value="account">…</Tabs.Content>
 * </Tabs>
 * ```
 *
 * **Swiping puts the panels in a row.** With `swipeable`, the panels are laid
 * out side by side in a strip as wide as all of them, inside a viewport that
 * shows one at a time, and moving between tabs is that strip translating. The
 * neighbours are therefore already built and already the right size before the
 * finger arrives at them, which is the whole point: a panel that has to be
 * mounted and measured at the moment it becomes visible is a panel that stalls
 * there, and it stalls for exactly as long as it takes to build.
 *
 * One shared value carries the strip's position, in panels rather than points,
 * and it is the only thing that decides where the strip is. A press springs it,
 * a drag sets it, and neither waits for React: the value the tab set reports is
 * updated alongside the movement, not ahead of it.
 *
 * A swipeable tab set therefore needs a height to fill, the same as any pager.
 * Give it one — `flex-1` on the tab set, or a fixed height — or the strip has
 * nothing to lay its panels out in.

 * level up.
 *
 * With `auto` the chain resolves both ways. Given a height, the panels fill it
 * and a virtualised list inside one has a real size to build against. Given
 * none, the strip is as tall as its tallest panel and every panel stretches to
 * match, so switching tabs does not change the tab set's height either.
