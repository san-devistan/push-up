/**
 * ProgressButton — press and hold to confirm, with the wait drawn on the button.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <ProgressButton onComplete={wipe}>
 *   <ProgressButton.Label>Hold to erase</ProgressButton.Label>
 * </ProgressButton>
 * ```
 *
 * For the action a confirmation dialog exists to slow down. A dialog asks the
 * question somewhere else and takes the answer as a tap — which is two taps,
 * and two taps in a row is a rhythm a hand falls into. A hold cannot be
 * completed by accident and cannot be completed by habit: it has to be
 * sustained, and the fill says for how much longer.
 *
 * ## The fill is the promise
 *
 * Nothing fires until the fill reaches the end. There is no tolerance near the
 * top, because a tolerance means the button sometimes commits after the reader
 * has deliberately let go — which is the one failure a confirmation control
 * cannot have. Released early, the fill drains back, in proportion to how far
 * it got.
 *
 * ## How it is drawn
 *
 * The fill is a clipped copy of the button in inverted colours, growing from
 * the leading edge. That is what keeps the label legible across the boundary:
 * a single label under a translucent wash goes muddy in the middle of the
 * wipe, exactly where the eye is. Two labels, each at full contrast on its own
 * ground, never do.
 *
 * The clip is a view under `overflow: 'hidden'`, and its width is animated.
 * Animating a width is normally a layout pass per frame; this view is
 * absolutely positioned over the button and its copy of the label is pinned to
 * the button's own width, so nothing it contains reflows as it grows.
 *
 * ## Reduced motion
 *
 * The wipe is replaced by a stepped fill that advances in fifths. The hold
 * still has to be legible — a control that asks you to wait and shows nothing
 * is a broken button — so this is a coarser indicator, not the absence of one.
